# Lattice-gases-in-Mathematica
Extensions to Mathematica for simulating lattice gas automata.  This includes a small set of "Simulation Kernel" routines that should be re-implemented in a low level language to get hardware-limited performance, higher level Mathematica routines that use the simulation kernel to define some language extensions that make LGA code easy to write and read, as well as a number of sample LGA experiments that can be run at a convenient speed even with the simulation kernel written in Mathematica.
